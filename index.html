          <li>To define just what "faster" or "better" means, companies must be able to capture from customers the set of metrics—measures of value, if you will—that define how they want to get the job done and what it means to get the job done perfectly.</li>
          <li>These metrics are the customers' desired outcomes.</li>
          <li>For most jobs, even those that may seem somewhat trivial, there are typically 50 to 150 or more desired outcomes—not just a handful.</li>
