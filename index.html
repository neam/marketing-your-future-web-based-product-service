        <h2>What to release and when?</h2>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>This is what you want to release in the first weeks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li></li>
          <li>Day 1 - Your dreams and inspirations (To family, friends and co-founders)</li>
          <li>Week 1-2 - Your requests to meet up and talk with those in your broader customer type</li>
          <li>Week 4-6 - Your innovation survey (Hint: Buy good relevant survey responses from audience services)</li>
          <li>Week 6-8 - A marketing page which includes a rough first version of your offerings</li>
          <li>Week 9-10 - Marketing efforts/campaigns for validation, learning and price-gauging (Cost-per-click paid advertising may be fine to start with)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Q: What about the actual product/service?</h2>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>A: First of all, forget about the notion of releasing a "product". It is never done in a vacuum.</h2>
        <h3>You are offering value delivered from your company as a whole, which may include the customer getting access to a product/service but the customer will always gauge the complete value she gets from the relation with your company, not the product in itself.</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>With that in mind, this is a generalized "Release schedule"</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Whenever your company can offer real value to your single most ideal customer, release to them</li>
          <li>Whenever your company can offer real value to your first ideal customer target segment, release to them</li>
          <li>Whenever your company can offer real value to another highly ideal customer target segment, release to them</li>
          <li>etc</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Be creative! Try to release as early and as often as possible!</h2>
        <h3>There is nothing that states that you need to build a product/service to deliver real value</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Example 1</h2>
        <h3>Release a whitepaper that outlines the business case for something relevant to your future offering in exchange for feedback or getting them to join a mailing list</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Example 2</h2>
        <h3>Release a competition in which one potential customer wins free consultancy hours for advice in how they can improve their business (in general), free installation and integration of an early access prototype, a year of premium support or similar etc</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Example 3</h2>
        <h3>Release early access to a tutorial or other documentation which helps the customer and yourselves gauge how well the solution might fit</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Don't release without a reason</h2>
        <h3>You want to be looking for the ability to gain critical insights in how well the solution will be aligned with the customer's need in order to prevent mistakes in the design of your solution</h3>
        <h3>If you don't have a plan to follow up on these early releases, you might skip them altogether</h3>
